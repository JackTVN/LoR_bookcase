Hastily making silk out of a human that looks courageous on the outside might end up yielding useless cloth that does nothing but bolster courage, so one must be careful with picking the right material.","Not every piece of fabric is accessible, however. It takes more than cash to purchase high-class fabric; one must earn the favor of Tailors first and foremost. Many Tailors will only give their best fabric once the trust between them and their client has been established after complex turns of events.","Because of that, Tailors who make high-quality fabric usually belong to an organization and create cloth exclusively for them.

Numerous needles were dispersed upon the explosion, flying in all directions. The needles which stuck onto building walls caused the site of impact to melt and crack; when a human was struck with one of the needles, they were transformed into A-02, going through the same bizarre process of detonation A-01 did. The orange symbol on the nape of A-01\u2019s neck was also found on the needles discharged from its body. When I arrived at the scene after taking the request, the bits of flesh scattered around the streets began to merge into one giant body using a brainstem focus resonator, becoming a 3-meter-tall (~10ft) mass that I will refer to as A-03. A-03 began throwing large needles, the length of which varied from 1 to 3 meters. Unlike the small needles fired from the explosion of A-01 or A-02 that could only leave small dents on building structures, the giant needles flung by A-03 caused buildings to helplessly melt. In addition, local residents who stared into the entity\u2019s eyes or holes in its body soon produced a boiling sound before turning into A-02, so I had to forbid people from observing it closely.","A-01 visited OO Office to give a request four days prior to the incident.

Unfortunately, the meaning of that voice was lost on me. Rather\u2026 it wasn\u2019t even human speech. An awkward sound mimicking somebody. Noises of teeth grinding, bones crackling, mingling with flesh. Some things collide, fall apart, and mix in irregular patterns as if to mimic the way humans speak. However, that sound was too violent and sharp. The strong obsession of an empty one. Attachment. Void. I\u2019m not sure what word I should use to define this.","One thing I understood was that only I could hear that voice, and that it rang in my head rather than my ears. The stronger and clearer my aim to protect someone became, the louder the noise in my head got. Anxious that my mind might be consumed by the voice if I let it weaken my will, I tried my best to pretend that I didn\u2019t hear it. The eyes on the blade carefully observed me as I fought the voice in my head. The piercing gaze persisted as if to replace me if I faltered even for a second; it made me feel hazy sometimes. The \u201cvoice\u201d was only a bunch of grinding noises at the beginning, but it slowly learned to speak over time. Soon enough, it started speaking in a language that I could understand, though it stammered a bit. It takes human hide to protect human flesh. A shell\u2026 It kept asking for a shell. I couldn\u2019t stop the voice, so the most I could do was ignore it.","Even though there was danger in using it, its power was formidable; with it, I protected many a person, and cut down many a threat. The voice became stronger and deeper with the more blood the blade drank. One day, it asked a sharp question: \u201cDon\u2019t you desire a human shell as well?\u201d When I think back on it, the question might not have been aimed at me specifically. It would only say whatever it wanted to say. It wouldn\u2019t try to convince or allure me. All it uttered was monologue. Yet, I was frozen stiff when I heard that. It kept saying something. Are our lives really worth the blood I spilt for them? It wasn\u2019t actually capable of forming such detailed sentences, but my head took it that way for some reason\u2026 Maybe I was thinking to myself.","I denied its claim at the start. I\u2019d never provoked anyone first. I\u2019d only acted to protect others from an approaching danger. But, I felt a small part of myself waver from what the voice said. What will remain when I keep washing away blood with blood? A bloodstained shell would be all that is left.","I collapsed for a moment; but I didn\u2019t stop thinking. If I broke down, I might be in danger as Carmen warned. Carmen\u2026 Right, Carmen would\u2019ve been different. Nothing could possibly beat the glitter in her eyes that shines as she pioneers a new path. Those honest, virtuous eyes\u2026 Even when someone jeered at her speech, even when everyone despaired in the face of an obstacle that brought progress to a halt, Carmen never stopped looking after others. She would always take the initiative to lead all of them. If I can protect a person like that, maybe this place will change? Yes. As long as I can protect that one person.","As my thoughts became clearer, I couldn\u2019t just sit down. My body acted before my head could decide what to do. I don\u2019t exactly remember what happened then. When I finally took a grip on my rationality in a vast mindscape and came back to my senses, my body was burning hot. Is this rage? Have I been taken over to the point where I can\u2019t even see ahead? But I felt so calm, refreshed even. My head was kept cool, while my heart leading the body was aflame. It wasn\u2019t long until I felt that something was different. On solid armor, there was a layer of something tough and dense, but it wasn\u2019t fabric\u2026 A veil of mist was covering me. Astonished, I moved around and shook my limbs several times, and the veil dissipated soon after.","When Carmen learned of this, she didn\u2019t say much. She didn\u2019t make a big fuss about it or suggest trying something with it right away. She only said that wielding this power is more important than simply manifesting it, so I shouldn\u2019t be lazy\u2026 She went back to work after leaving that peculiar piece of advice. Maybe she didn\u2019t want me to feel too much pressure.","As more time passed, I could use the armor for longer, and eventually got to draw out its full power. I had a weapon and armor that resonate with my emotions. Using them, I could protect more people, and I was able to draw forth more durability and strength. The researchers seemed to be struggling to make progress with their work, but it was alright. I believed in them to make it through, and I just had to be quicker to do my job in the meantime. However, not long after, the incident happened all too suddenly. No, maybe it wasn\u2019t so sudden. The sign was there.","Just around this corner, I can hear a child crying; she\u2019s sitting in front of a door. One of the two children Carmen took in died in a failed experiment. Unlike Lisa who was wary and reluctant to open up to us, Enoch showed interest in our research, and volunteered to be a test subject the other day. Enoch\u2019s speech was so concise and on point, everyone was shocked. He wasn\u2019t afraid, and he wasn\u2019t shaking\u2026 His voice was unswerving and gentle. Enoch\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t those of a naive little kid. His words and thoughts were surprisingly deep and mature; even I was astonished. I sometimes wondered what made this kid have such thoughts. His eyes seemed to have already seen so much of this world\u2019s despair and misfortune. However, it was still no reason to allow a kid to participate in the experiments. Carmen spent several nights agonizing over the matter.","The experiment was authorized at last, though I didn\u2019t want to know what they thought of it anymore. What were they going to do, holding the hand of that little kid? I had to wonder if we were that desperate. But I shrugged it off. I wasn\u2019t one to stop him from doing what he chose to do.","\u201cYou should\u2019ve been the one to die\u2026\u201d The other kid, who was now all alone, mumbled crying. Her words had no weight to it. She probably spouted what she didn\u2019t sincerely mean, because the situation was too much for her.","\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2014 I should have died.\u201d Carmen\u2019s answer, on the other hand, was likely sincere. Everyone stood still. A crack appeared in our minds which we never thought would crumble. Maybe we all expected it to happen deep down.","Carmen\u2019s state worsened with each passing day, like a rusting nail. The sunny eyes of the woman who had brought us together were now cloudy, and she spoke less and less. Her voice was lifeless, and she had gotten so cold; it wouldn\u2019t have come to anyone\u2019s surprise if she died at any moment. She didn\u2019t bother trying to look okay. I think it was better that way. Everyone in the laboratory felt constraint in her presence. They viewed Carmen in different ways. Reproachful looks of those resenting her for bringing them so far, only to let go of her responsibility. Concerned looks of those worried that something might happen to her. And I guess there were some who had no thoughts. The research went on quietly, but not for long.","A few days later, Carmen spilled out all of the guilt within her and plunged into it, never to come back up."]},{ID:"250023",Name:"Nikolai\u2019s Page",Level:"Star of the City",Source:"R Corp",Obtainable:"True",Rarity:"Objet D'art",Speed:[2,7],HP:101,StaggerHP:53,SResist:[0,0],PResist:[1,1],BResist:[0,0],Skin:"Nicolai",Passive:["10008","250123","250023","250223"],Desc:["After a moment of silence, she slowly opened her mouth.

How could a person be so cold and heartless, even if the basic bearing of a Fixer is to look after oneself first and foremost? At first, I spent much time thinking over it, and asked myself many questions. Xiao as a person valued the lives of her colleagues, although her position forced her to keep her farewell to deceased teammates short, since carrying out her duty and emerging victorious came first. Shedding fewer drops of tears than the number of fallen was all the tribute I could pay. Bawling my eyes out would have stirred uneasiness in my colleagues. In the early days, the responsibility sometimes felt too heavy and burdensome.","I had never once thought that my method was incorrect; I believed it to be the best method for myself, and I deemed that problems couldn\u2019t be solved any other way. Most Fixers will probably think in the same way. Therefore, I could not understand the manners of Lowell, the newly appointed Section 2 Director at the time. A person who tries to look after everyone, and doesn\u2019t hide his grief-stricken face when a coworker passes away. It seemed clear as crystal that his tenderness would one day lead his team to death, yet he was faring better than I thought. A polar opposite to me. The ways I wanted to pursue but gave up because I was faced with my limitations. It might have upset me for a moment. A principle I could not follow, for I was not allowed to openly express sadness over the death of the few in order to protect the many; and my obligation to seize any chance of victory compelled me to march forward if there was something to count on. My capability wasn\u2019t vast enough to embrace every member of the team. Was my choice wrong? What did he have that I did not? Looking back, I don\u2019t think what I felt was envy or jealousy. The indignation certainly was not a toxic emotion. I\u2019m sure each of us had different specialties.","It is said that people intersect with one another in some manner. I don\u2019t think the process to be natural at all; I was not a believer of fateful meetings. After all, two parallel roads could never cross. A relationship begins with a desire to know. Simple curiosity. To know more about a person, or to go further and see what they are seeing together. People open up new roads to merge into the roads of others for various reasons.","I thought I would never care about him since he was so different from me, but my expectations weren\u2019t quite right. I wanted to learn more about him, and I wanted to know what this emotion I felt was. And I thought I could perhaps become a better person if I saw what he was seeing together. If there\u2019s one thing I realized, it\u2019s that relationships between people always start from such small curiosity.","Taking in what I have said so far, you would think that this is such a peculiar and untruthful love. You might think it\u2019s fussy. I cannot give out a clear answer, for I can\u2019t dare define what love is. What could I say or add about an emotion I felt for the first time, one that I am still struggling to figure out? Furthermore, every person carries a different form of love. There will undoubtedly be some people who don\u2019t place much importance on that emotion. You might even think that such emotion is absolutely useless in this City. Even if I were to define my love, this wouldn\u2019t come across as a sweet story if you cannot understand it.","However, I can be certain that my sentiment towards Lowell was sincere. The so-called curiosity and sympathy\u2026 They bring about attention, admiration, and a little bit of obsession. I learned soon enough that this isn\u2019t much different from what people call \u201clove\u201d. It may not have been something out of a fairy tale or a drama, but we still cherished each other in our little relationship. Perhaps I had been under the impression that love is a concept that is utterly distant from me. The love that I came into was cramped, yet big\u2026 and it felt burdensome at times.","You said I am strong, but the truth is that I was weak and fainthearted until the very last time I faced you. I have only grown so ironclad after I lost you. Why did I miss everything while you were still by my side? Why do I spend the whole night longing for you and regretting only after you have parted from me? I do have one regret regarding you: that I could not trust my feelings for you. That I was too afraid to tell you that you\u2019re my everything the night before you left me.","Moments of loneliness will come as I live. It won\u2019t be a thirsty longing for love, however. It is when I look to my side, yet there is no one next to me; when I am worn out from running somewhere; when I feel that my heart grows heavy rather than painful. Trying new things might let me forget it for a moment, but the memories will still follow me for life. When I feel such things, I can go back to familiarity.
