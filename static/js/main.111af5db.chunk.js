Therefore, there is more to being a Tailor than simply weaving silk carefully. Picking the right people to meet the demands of the client is the most important. Hastily making silk out of a human that looks courageous on the outside might end up yielding useless cloth that does nothing but bolster courage, so one must be careful with picking the right material.","Not every piece of fabric is accessible, however.

Numerous needles were dispersed upon the explosion, flying in all directions. The needles which stuck onto building walls caused the site of impact to melt and crack; when a human was struck with one of the needles, they were transformed into A-02, going through the same bizarre process of detonation A-01 did. The orange symbol on the nape of A-01\u2019s neck was also found on the needles discharged from its body. When I arrived at the scene after taking the request, the bits of flesh scattered around the streets began to merge into one giant body using a brainstem focus resonator, becoming a 3-meter-tall (~10ft) mass that I will refer to as A-03. A-03 began throwing large needles, the length of which varied from 1 to 3 meters. Unlike the small needles fired from the explosion of A-01 or A-02 that could only leave small dents on building structures, the giant needles flung by A-03 caused buildings to helplessly melt. In addition, local residents who stared into the entity\u2019s eyes or holes in its body soon produced a boiling sound before turning into A-02, so I had to forbid people from observing it closely.","A-01 visited OO Office to give a request four days prior to the incident.

Unfortunately, the meaning of that voice was lost on me. Rather\u2026 it wasn\u2019t even human speech. An awkward sound mimicking somebody. Noises of teeth grinding, bones crackling, mingling with flesh. Some things collide, fall apart, and mix in irregular patterns as if to mimic the way humans speak. However, that sound was too violent and sharp. The strong obsession of an empty one. Attachment. Void.

Anxious that my mind might be consumed by the voice if I let it weaken my will, I tried my best to pretend that I didn\u2019t hear it.

The \u201cvoice\u201d was only a bunch of grinding noises at the beginning, but it slowly learned to speak over time.

It would only say whatever it wanted to say. It wouldn\u2019t try to convince or allure me. All it uttered was monologue. Yet, I was frozen stiff when I heard that. It kept saying something. Are our lives really worth the blood I spilt for them?

She would always take the initiative to lead all of them. If I can protect a person like that, maybe this place will change? Yes.

Have I been taken over to the point where I can\u2019t even see ahead? But I felt so calm, refreshed even. My head was kept cool, while my heart leading the body was aflame. It wasn\u2019t long until I felt that something was different. On solid armor, there was a layer of something tough and dense, but it wasn\u2019t fabric\u2026 A veil of mist was covering me.

Enoch\u2019s speech was so concise and on point, everyone was shocked. He wasn\u2019t afraid, and he wasn\u2019t shaking\u2026 His voice was unswerving and gentle. Enoch\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t those of a naive little kid. His words and thoughts were surprisingly deep and mature; even I was astonished. I sometimes wondered what made this kid have such thoughts. His eyes seemed to have already seen so much of this world\u2019s despair and misfortune. However, it was still no reason to allow a kid to participate in the experiments. Carmen spent several nights agonizing over the matter.","The experiment was authorized at last, though I didn\u2019t want to know what they thought of it anymore. What were they going to do, holding the hand of that little kid? I had to wonder if we were that desperate. But I shrugged it off.

Her words had no weight to it. She probably spouted what she didn\u2019t sincerely mean, because the situation was too much for her.","\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2014 I should have died.\u201d Carmen\u2019s answer, on the other hand, was likely sincere. Everyone stood still. A crack appeared in our minds which we never thought would crumble. Maybe we all expected it to happen deep down.","Carmen\u2019s state worsened with each passing day, like a rusting nail. The sunny eyes of the woman who had brought us together were now cloudy, and she spoke less and less. Her voice was lifeless, and she had gotten so cold; it wouldn\u2019t have come to anyone\u2019s surprise if she died at any moment. She didn\u2019t bother trying to look okay. I think it was better that way. Everyone in the laboratory felt constraint in her presence. They viewed Carmen in different ways. Reproachful looks of those resenting her for bringing them so far, only to let go of her responsibility. Concerned looks of those worried that something might happen to her. And I guess there were some who had no thoughts. The research went on quietly, but not for long.","A few days later, Carmen spilled out all of the guilt within her and plunged into it, never to come back up."]},{ID:"250023",Name:"Nikolai\u2019s Page",Level:"Star of the City",Source:"R Corp",Obtainable:"True",Rarity:"Objet D'art",Speed:[2,7],HP:101,StaggerHP:53,SResist:[0,0],PResist:[1,1],BResist:[0,0],Skin:"Nicolai",Passive:["10008","250123","250023","250223"],Desc:["After a moment of silence, she slowly opened her mouth.

How could a person be so cold and heartless, even if the basic bearing of a Fixer is to look after oneself first and foremost? At first, I spent much time thinking over it, and asked myself many questions. Xiao as a person valued the lives of her colleagues, although her position forced her to keep her farewell to deceased teammates short, since carrying out her duty and emerging victorious came first. Shedding fewer drops of tears than the number of fallen was all the tribute I could pay. Bawling my eyes out would have stirred uneasiness in my colleagues. In the early days, the responsibility sometimes felt too heavy and burdensome.","I had never once thought that my method was incorrect; I believed it to be the best method for myself, and I deemed that problems couldn\u2019t be solved any other way. Most Fixers will probably think in the same way. Therefore, I could not understand the manners of Lowell, the newly appointed Section 2 Director at the time. A person who tries to look after everyone, and doesn\u2019t hide his grief-stricken face when a coworker passes away. It seemed clear as crystal that his tenderness would one day lead his team to death, yet he was faring better than I thought. A polar opposite to me. The ways I wanted to pursue but gave up because I was faced with my limitations. It might have upset me for a moment. A principle I could not follow, for I was not allowed to openly express sadness over the death of the few in order to protect the many; and my obligation to seize any chance of victory compelled me to march forward if there was something to count on. My capability wasn\u2019t vast enough to embrace every member of the team. Was my choice wrong? What did he have that I did not? Looking back, I don\u2019t think what I felt was envy or jealousy. The indignation certainly was not a toxic emotion. I\u2019m sure each of us had different specialties.","It is said that people intersect with one another in some manner. I don\u2019t think the process to be natural at all; I was not a believer of fateful meetings. After all, two parallel roads could never cross. A relationship begins with a desire to know. Simple curiosity. To know more about a person, or to go further and see what they are seeing together. People open up new roads to merge into the roads of others for various reasons.","I thought I would never care about him since he was so different from me, but my expectations weren\u2019t quite right. I wanted to learn more about him, and I wanted to know what this emotion I felt was. And I thought I could perhaps become a better person if I saw what he was seeing together. If there\u2019s one thing I realized, it\u2019s that relationships between people always start from such small curiosity.","Taking in what I have said so far, you would think that this is such a peculiar and untruthful love. You might think it\u2019s fussy. I cannot give out a clear answer, for I can\u2019t dare define what love is. What could I say or add about an emotion I felt for the first time, one that I am still struggling to figure out? Furthermore, every person carries a different form of love. There will undoubtedly be some people who don\u2019t place much importance on that emotion. You might even think that such emotion is absolutely useless in this City. Even if I were to define my love, this wouldn\u2019t come across as a sweet story if you cannot understand it.","However, I can be certain that my sentiment towards Lowell was sincere. The so-called curiosity and sympathy\u2026 They bring about attention, admiration, and a little bit of obsession. I learned soon enough that this isn\u2019t much different from what people call \u201clove\u201d. It may not have been something out of a fairy tale or a drama, but we still cherished each other in our little relationship. Perhaps I had been under the impression that love is a concept that is utterly distant from me. The love that I came into was cramped, yet big\u2026 and it felt burdensome at times.","You said I am strong, but the truth is that I was weak and fainthearted until the very last time I faced you. I have only grown so ironclad after I lost you. Why did I miss everything while you were still by my side? Why do I spend the whole night longing for you and regretting only after you have parted from me? I do have one regret regarding you: that I could not trust my feelings for you. That I was too afraid to tell you that you\u2019re my everything the night before you left me.","Moments of loneliness will come as I live. It won\u2019t be a thirsty longing for love, however. It is when I look to my side, yet there is no one next to me; when I am worn out from running somewhere; when I feel that my heart grows heavy rather than painful. Trying new things might let me forget it for a moment, but the memories will still follow me for life. When I feel such things, I can go back to familiarity.

All the fresh-looking Prescript contained was a command to be a Messenger. It was pointing toward a beginning, not an end. I couldn\u2019t see a single word that said anything about salvation or death.

While a clear conclusion on this case has yet to be made, it is speculated to be a case of the Distortion based on the apparent inability to confirm the cause or analyze the composition.","Case Report: Entity A-01, the first apparent source of the incident, was wandering the Backstreets of District 22 before swelling up and exploding. Numerous needles were dispersed upon the explosion, flying in all directions. The needles which stuck onto building walls caused the site of impact to melt and crack; when a human was struck with one of the needles, they were transformed into A-02, going through the same bizarre process of detonation A-01 did. The orange symbol on the nape of A-01\u2019s neck was also found on the needles discharged from its body. When I arrived at the scene after taking the request, the bits of flesh scattered around the streets began to merge into one giant body using a brainstem focus resonator, becoming a 3-meter-tall (~10ft) mass that I will refer to as A-03. A-03 began throwing large needles, the length of which varied from 1 to 3 meters. Unlike the small needles fired from the explosion of A-01 or A-02 that could only leave small dents on building structures, the giant needles flung by A-03 caused buildings to helplessly melt. In addition, local residents who stared into the entity\u2019s eyes or holes in its body soon produced a boiling sound before turning into A-02, so I had to forbid people from observing it closely.","A-01 visited OO Office to give a request four days prior to the incident.

You don't have to eat the bones.)\u2019 You\u2019d think this is an absurd instruction no sane person could follow, but those who belong to the Index will feel glad that it doesn\u2019t require chopping off both feet or eating the bones."]},{ID:"150018",Name:"Chun\u2019s Page",Level:"Star of the City",Source:"abcdef",Obtainable:"False",Rarity:"Limited",Speed:[2,6],HP:126,StaggerHP:62,SResist:[0,0],PResist:[0,1],BResist:[1,0],Skin:"Chun",Passive:["10001","250001","250018","3009"],Desc:["Right now, Nest L is practically a warzone with all the Associations, Syndicates, and Fixers at each other\u2019s throats.

The weapon that corresponds to the mind of its wielder. The sword Carmen gave me was extracted from someone by chance. Giant eyeballs were attached to the sword adorned with crimson chunks of flesh; they watched my every move, almost to the point of making me feel a bit uncomfortable. Wondering if this was a product of some new Singularity, I asked Carmen what the thing was; she only said that I\u2019ll have to get used to it, since there\u2019s little she can do about how it looks. Although it looked a bit creepy, it wasn\u2019t anything unbearable, and Carmen didn\u2019t seem to mind it as long as there were experiments to be performed with it. She added that I have to be careful with it as it was thanks to sheer luck that the \u201cE.G.O\u201d could be extracted at all in its unstable state. I had a plethora of experience handling various workshop products, so I decided to take the sword without much hesitation.","When I first had the sword in my grip, I didn\u2019t feel anything in particular. All I could tell is that it\u2019s just a big, heavy greatsword; nothing out of the ordinary other than its appearance. But when I held the sword a few days later to protect a coworker of mine, I heard a voice. It was the voice of someone desperately yearning for something. Unfortunately, the meaning of that voice was lost on me. Rather\u2026 it wasn\u2019t even human speech. An awkward sound mimicking somebody. Noises of teeth grinding, bones crackling, mingling with flesh. Some things collide, fall apart, and mix in irregular patterns as if to mimic the way humans speak. However, that sound was too violent and sharp. The strong obsession of an empty one. Attachment. Void. I\u2019m not sure what word I should use to define this.","One thing I understood was that only I could hear that voice, and that it rang in my head rather than my ears. The stronger and clearer my aim to protect someone became, the louder the noise in my head got. Anxious that my mind might be consumed by the voice if I let it weaken my will, I tried my best to pretend that I didn\u2019t hear it. The eyes on the blade carefully observed me as I fought the voice in my head. The piercing gaze persisted as if to replace me if I faltered even for a second; it made me feel hazy sometimes. The \u201cvoice\u201d was only a bunch of grinding noises at the beginning, but it slowly learned to speak over time. Soon enough, it started speaking in a language that I could understand, though it stammered a bit. It takes human hide to protect human flesh. A shell\u2026 It kept asking for a shell. I couldn\u2019t stop the voice, so the most I could do was ignore it.","Even though there was danger in using it, its power was formidable; with it, I protected many a person, and cut down many a threat. The voice became stronger and deeper with the more blood the blade drank. One day, it asked a sharp question: \u201cDon\u2019t you desire a human shell as well?\u201d When I think back on it, the question might not have been aimed at me specifically. It would only say whatever it wanted to say. It wouldn\u2019t try to convince or allure me. All it uttered was monologue. Yet, I was frozen stiff when I heard that. It kept saying something. Are our lives really worth the blood I spilt for them? It wasn\u2019t actually capable of forming such detailed sentences, but my head took it that way for some reason\u2026 Maybe I was thinking to myself.","I denied its claim at the start. I\u2019d never provoked anyone first. I\u2019d only acted to protect others from an approaching danger. But, I felt a small part of myself waver from what the voice said. What will remain when I keep washing away blood with blood? A bloodstained shell would be all that is left.","I collapsed for a moment; but I didn\u2019t stop thinking. If I broke down, I might be in danger as Carmen warned. Carmen\u2026 Right, Carmen would\u2019ve been different. Nothing could possibly beat the glitter in her eyes that shines as she pioneers a new path. Those honest, virtuous eyes\u2026 Even when someone jeered at her speech, even when everyone despaired in the face of an obstacle that brought progress to a halt, Carmen never stopped looking after others. She would always take the initiative to lead all of them. If I can protect a person like that, maybe this place will change? Yes. As long as I can protect that one person.","As my thoughts became clearer, I couldn\u2019t just sit down. My body acted before my head could decide what to do. I don\u2019t exactly remember what happened then. When I finally took a grip on my rationality in a vast mindscape and came back to my senses, my body was burning hot. Is this rage? Have I been taken over to the point where I can\u2019t even see ahead? But I felt so calm, refreshed even. My head was kept cool, while my heart leading the body was aflame. It wasn\u2019t long until I felt that something was different. On solid armor, there was a layer of something tough and dense, but it wasn\u2019t fabric\u2026 A veil of mist was covering me. Astonished, I moved around and shook my limbs several times, and the veil dissipated soon after.","When Carmen learned of this, she didn\u2019t say much. She didn\u2019t make a big fuss about it or suggest trying something with it right away. She only said that wielding this power is more important than simply manifesting it, so I shouldn\u2019t be lazy\u2026 She went back to work after leaving that peculiar piece of advice. Maybe she didn\u2019t want me to feel too much pressure.","As more time passed, I could use the armor for longer, and eventually got to draw out its full power. I had a weapon and armor that resonate with my emotions. Using them, I could protect more people, and I was able to draw forth more durability and strength. The researchers seemed to be struggling to make progress with their work, but it was alright. I believed in them to make it through, and I just had to be quicker to do my job in the meantime. However, not long after, the incident happened all too suddenly. No, maybe it wasn\u2019t so sudden. The sign was there.","Just around this corner, I can hear a child crying; she\u2019s sitting in front of a door. One of the two children Carmen took in died in a failed experiment. Unlike Lisa who was wary and reluctant to open up to us, Enoch showed interest in our research, and volunteered to be a test subject the other day. Enoch\u2019s speech was so concise and on point, everyone was shocked. He wasn\u2019t afraid, and he wasn\u2019t shaking\u2026 His voice was unswerving and gentle. Enoch\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t those of a naive little kid. His words and thoughts were surprisingly deep and mature; even I was astonished. I sometimes wondered what made this kid have such thoughts. His eyes seemed to have already seen so much of this world\u2019s despair and misfortune. However, it was still no reason to allow a kid to participate in the experiments. Carmen spent several nights agonizing over the matter.","The experiment was authorized at last, though I didn\u2019t want to know what they thought of it anymore. What were they going to do, holding the hand of that little kid? I had to wonder if we were that desperate. But I shrugged it off. I wasn\u2019t one to stop him from doing what he chose to do.","\u201cYou should\u2019ve been the one to die\u2026\u201d The other kid, who was now all alone, mumbled crying. Her words had no weight to it. She probably spouted what she didn\u2019t sincerely mean, because the situation was too much for her.","\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2014 I should have died.\u201d Carmen\u2019s answer, on the other hand, was likely sincere. Everyone stood still. A crack appeared in our minds which we never thought would crumble. Maybe we all expected it to happen deep down.","Carmen\u2019s state worsened with each passing day, like a rusting nail. The sunny eyes of the woman who had brought us together were now cloudy, and she spoke less and less. Her voice was lifeless, and she had gotten so cold; it wouldn\u2019t have come to anyone\u2019s surprise if she died at any moment. She didn\u2019t bother trying to look okay. I think it was better that way. Everyone in the laboratory felt constraint in her presence. They viewed Carmen in different ways. Reproachful looks of those resenting her for bringing them so far, only to let go of her responsibility. Concerned looks of those worried that something might happen to her. And I guess there were some who had no thoughts. The research went on quietly, but not for long.","A few days later, Carmen spilled out all of the guilt within her and plunged into it, never to come back up."]},{ID:"150035",Name:"The Purple Tear\u2019s Page",Level:"Star of the City",Source:"abcdef",Obtainable:"False",Rarity:"Objet D'art",Speed:[2,7],HP:700,StaggerHP:290,SResist:[1,0],PResist:[0,0],BResist:[0,1],Skin:"ThePurpleTear_F",Passive:["250227","250027","250327","250427"],Desc:["If you\u2019re reading this book, it must mean there\u2019s something you want to know about me.

Let\u2019s say that you sidetracked on your way home and were killed by some Syndicate members that ambushed you. But in another world, you might have decided you wanna go straight home, and the assault would\u2019ve never happened.

It\u2019s blindingly bright at times, and it shakes in an irregular shape at times. This sensation is often called a phosphene. Whenever I close my eyes, the blurry image of a bloodstained carpet appears to me like that optical phenomenon. The beginning of an unpleasant nightmare. Four mannequins that lost a face and an arm each are lying on the carpet, spilling red beads; another mannequin has its hand on my shoulder. I turn around and look at the loudspeaker in the mannequin\u2019s face. I can feel the vibration coming from it, even though I can\u2019t hear what it says. But I already know what sound this mannequin is making. The vibration precisely matches the words I remember, and my heart starts beating accordingly.","This damned power of recall lost all my good childhood memories to oblivion, yet it brings back such remembrances every time I close my eyes. My response to it is always the same: Take the flower that\u2019s slipped into my hand and nail it into the mannequin\u2019s heart. A beautiful tree in bloom grows from the cracks the flower made. It\u2019s as soft as the hands that caressed me, and it\u2019s as pretty as the sound that consoled me. And it\u2019s as sharp as the noise of that last moment when I was scolded for the first time. Every branch that grows from the tree causes a piercing buzz in my ears, and the petals hurt as they brush past my cheeks as if to make me feel the pain they hold. I stand still like my feet were tied, until my body is covered in scars. One, two\u2026 Black marbles fall from the wounds. How long have I been in this cycle of pain?","The nightmares have been with me for a good majority of my life. If I close my eyes, the memory of that time haunts me\u2014and if I open my eyes, a reality I can hardly bear unfolds. I chose to keep my eyes shut because I thought I\u2019d rather deal with the ever-echoing past. At least I won\u2019t be visited by new kinds of pain\u2026 Prescripts keep coming without a break. The City folk meet different ends depending on the Prescripts they receive, though their fates all share a commonality of cruelty. Their resentment, screams, tears, rage, and death\u2026 It\u2019s too much for my eyes. I sometimes thought how my life would\u2019ve been if I stayed as a commoner taking Prescripts like them. Maybe I was better off back then. Maybe I should\u2019ve just died early so I could breathe again as another being. Why did the Prescripts give me that order that day?","I trace back the nightmares to remember the past; everything was over, and I planned to follow them to death, but I didn\u2019t have the courage to end my own life, so I\u2026 I picked up the Prescript that I thought would spell my doom at last and read it slowly. All the fresh-looking Prescript contained was a command to be a Messenger. It was pointing toward a beginning, not an end. I couldn\u2019t see a single word that said anything about salvation or death. After being numb for a while, I finally tumbled down to the floor and broke into laughter louder than any sound I\u2019d made before. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at my state. I wanted to end my life because of Prescripts, and now the Prescripts won\u2019t even let me do that. Where has my free will run off to?","I was frustrated. Not even my own life was under my control, for everything relies on the Prescripts. Then I\u2019ll gladly play along. Even if I can\u2019t shatter the Prescripts, I\u2019ll at least make a tiny crack. If I can show the masses that it\u2019s possible to oppose the Prescripts, something might change\u2026 Something has to\u2026 It WILL make a difference. Once I had hope, I could see the way\u2014and once I could see where to go, I had the strength to get up.","However, I realized it only just now. What I felt wasn\u2019t hope, and that ignoring that Prescript and taking my own life as I\u2019d planned might have been a truer expression of my free will.","What is the right way to live a life in this place, I must wonder? I\u2019m not even dreaming of a life that I can be proud of; how does one achieve the feeling that their life is bearable to live, let alone be satisfied with it? I thought I had found an answer to that\u2026 But in the end, I couldn\u2019t escape the Prescripts. The Prescripts are the City\u2019s will as it is my will. I\u2019ve realized my limit. I feel as if I\u2019ve hit some kind of wall I can\u2019t overcome. However, I don\u2019t feel all too forlorn and miserable. Maybe there\u2019ll be someone who can ride along with the flow, rather than break it. It just won\u2019t be me; I\u2019m not fit to accomplish such things.","So I want someone to find an answer in my stead. And I hope they can tell me that.

The weapon that corresponds to the mind of its wielder. The sword Carmen gave me was extracted from someone by chance. Giant eyeballs were attached to the sword adorned with crimson chunks of flesh; they watched my every move, almost to the point of making me feel a bit uncomfortable. Wondering if this was a product of some new Singularity, I asked Carmen what the thing was; she only said that I\u2019ll have to get used to it, since there\u2019s little she can do about how it looks. Although it looked a bit creepy, it wasn\u2019t anything unbearable, and Carmen didn\u2019t seem to mind it as long as there were experiments to be performed with it. She added that I have to be careful with it as it was thanks to sheer luck that the \u201cE.G.O\u201d could be extracted at all in its unstable state. I had a plethora of experience handling various workshop products, so I decided to take the sword without much hesitation.","When I first had the sword in my grip, I didn\u2019t feel anything in particular. All I could tell is that it\u2019s just a big, heavy greatsword; nothing out of the ordinary other than its appearance. But when I held the sword a few days later to protect a coworker of mine, I heard a voice. It was the voice of someone desperately yearning for something. Unfortunately, the meaning of that voice was lost on me. Rather\u2026 it wasn\u2019t even human speech. An awkward sound mimicking somebody. Noises of teeth grinding, bones crackling, mingling with flesh. Some things collide, fall apart, and mix in irregular patterns as if to mimic the way humans speak. However, that sound was too violent and sharp. The strong obsession of an empty one. Attachment. Void. I\u2019m not sure what word I should use to define this.","One thing I understood was that only I could hear that voice, and that it rang in my head rather than my ears. The stronger and clearer my aim to protect someone became, the louder the noise in my head got. Anxious that my mind might be consumed by the voice if I let it weaken my will, I tried my best to pretend that I didn\u2019t hear it. The eyes on the blade carefully observed me as I fought the voice in my head. The piercing gaze persisted as if to replace me if I faltered even for a second; it made me feel hazy sometimes. The \u201cvoice\u201d was only a bunch of grinding noises at the beginning, but it slowly learned to speak over time. Soon enough, it started speaking in a language that I could understand, though it stammered a bit. It takes human hide to protect human flesh. A shell\u2026 It kept asking for a shell. I couldn\u2019t stop the voice, so the most I could do was ignore it.","Even though there was danger in using it, its power was formidable; with it, I protected many a person, and cut down many a threat. The voice became stronger and deeper with the more blood the blade drank. One day, it asked a sharp question: \u201cDon\u2019t you desire a human shell as well?\u201d When I think back on it, the question might not have been aimed at me specifically. It would only say whatever it wanted to say. It wouldn\u2019t try to convince or allure me. All it uttered was monologue. Yet, I was frozen stiff when I heard that. It kept saying something. Are our lives really worth the blood I spilt for them? It wasn\u2019t actually capable of forming such detailed sentences, but my head took it that way for some reason\u2026 Maybe I was thinking to myself.","I denied its claim at the start. I\u2019d never provoked anyone first. I\u2019d only acted to protect others from an approaching danger. But, I felt a small part of myself waver from what the voice said. What will remain when I keep washing away blood with blood? A bloodstained shell would be all that is left.","I collapsed for a moment; but I didn\u2019t stop thinking. If I broke down, I might be in danger as Carmen warned. Carmen\u2026 Right, Carmen would\u2019ve been different. Nothing could possibly beat the glitter in her eyes that shines as she pioneers a new path. Those honest, virtuous eyes\u2026 Even when someone jeered at her speech, even when everyone despaired in the face of an obstacle that brought progress to a halt, Carmen never stopped looking after others. She would always take the initiative to lead all of them. If I can protect a person like that, maybe this place will change? Yes. As long as I can protect that one person.","As my thoughts became clearer, I couldn\u2019t just sit down. My body acted before my head could decide what to do. I don\u2019t exactly remember what happened then. When I finally took a grip on my rationality in a vast mindscape and came back to my senses, my body was burning hot. Is this rage? Have I been taken over to the point where I can\u2019t even see ahead? But I felt so calm, refreshed even. My head was kept cool, while my heart leading the body was aflame. It wasn\u2019t long until I felt that something was different. On solid armor, there was a layer of something tough and dense, but it wasn\u2019t fabric\u2026 A veil of mist was covering me. Astonished, I moved around and shook my limbs several times, and the veil dissipated soon after.","When Carmen learned of this, she didn\u2019t say much. She didn\u2019t make a big fuss about it or suggest trying something with it right away. She only said that wielding this power is more important than simply manifesting it, so I shouldn\u2019t be lazy\u2026 She went back to work after leaving that peculiar piece of advice. Maybe she didn\u2019t want me to feel too much pressure.","As more time passed, I could use the armor for longer, and eventually got to draw out its full power. I had a weapon and armor that resonate with my emotions. Using them, I could protect more people, and I was able to draw forth more durability and strength. The researchers seemed to be struggling to make progress with their work, but it was alright. I believed in them to make it through, and I just had to be quicker to do my job in the meantime. However, not long after, the incident happened all too suddenly. No, maybe it wasn\u2019t so sudden. The sign was there.","Just around this corner, I can hear a child crying; she\u2019s sitting in front of a door. One of the two children Carmen took in died in a failed experiment. Unlike Lisa who was wary and reluctant to open up to us, Enoch showed interest in our research, and volunteered to be a test subject the other day. Enoch\u2019s speech was so concise and on point, everyone was shocked. He wasn\u2019t afraid, and he wasn\u2019t shaking\u2026 His voice was unswerving and gentle. Enoch\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t those of a naive little kid. His words and thoughts were surprisingly deep and mature; even I was astonished. I sometimes wondered what made this kid have such thoughts. His eyes seemed to have already seen so much of this world\u2019s despair and misfortune. However, it was still no reason to allow a kid to participate in the experiments. Carmen spent several nights agonizing over the matter.","The experiment was authorized at last, though I didn\u2019t want to know what they thought of it anymore. What were they going to do, holding the hand of that little kid? I had to wonder if we were that desperate. But I shrugged it off. I wasn\u2019t one to stop him from doing what he chose to do.","\u201cYou should\u2019ve been the one to die\u2026\u201d The other kid, who was now all alone, mumbled crying. Her words had no weight to it. She probably spouted what she didn\u2019t sincerely mean, because the situation was too much for her.","\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2014 I should have died.\u201d Carmen\u2019s answer, on the other hand, was likely sincere. Everyone stood still. A crack appeared in our minds which we never thought would crumble. Maybe we all expected it to happen deep down.","Carmen\u2019s state worsened with each passing day, like a rusting nail. The sunny eyes of the woman who had brought us together were now cloudy, and she spoke less and less. Her voice was lifeless, and she had gotten so cold; it wouldn\u2019t have come to anyone\u2019s surprise if she died at any moment. She didn\u2019t bother trying to look okay. I think it was better that way. Everyone in the laboratory felt constraint in her presence. They viewed Carmen in different ways. Reproachful looks of those resenting her for bringing them so far, only to let go of her responsibility. Concerned looks of those worried that something might happen to her. And I guess there were some who had no thoughts. The research went on quietly, but not for long.","A few days later, Carmen spilled out all of the guilt within her and plunged into it, never to come back up."]},{ID:"180005",Name:"Patron Librarian of Philosophy\u2019s Page",Level:"Library",Source:"abcdef",Obtainable:"False",Rarity:"Objet D'art",Speed:[2,7],HP:115,StaggerHP:70,SResist:[1,2],PResist:[0,0],BResist:[0,0],Skin:"Binah",Passive:["10008","10010","180005"],Desc:[]},{ID:"1408011",Name:"Elena\u2019s Page",Level:"Impuritas Civitatis",Source:"abcdef",Obtainable:"False",Rarity:"Objet D'art",Speed:[2,7],HP:400,StaggerHP:310,SResist:[1,1],PResist:[0,0],BResist:[0,0],Skin:"TwistedElena",Passive:["1408011","1408012","260013"],Desc:[""]},{ID:"1410011",Name:"Argalia\u2019s Page",Level:"Star of the City",Source:"abcdef",Obtainable:"False",Rarity:"Objet D'art",Speed:[4,6],HP:575,StaggerHP:410,SResist:[0,1],PResist:[0,0],BResist:[1,0],Skin:"TwistedArgalia",Passive:["1410011","260005","1410012","1410013","1410014","1408012"],Desc:[""]},{ID:"1410012",Name:"",Level:"Impuritas Civitatis",Source:"abcdef",Obtainable:"False",Rarity:"Objet D'art",Speed:[4,6],HP:700,StaggerHP:550,SResist:[0,1],PResist:[0,0],BResist:[1,0],Skin:"BlackSilence",Passive:[],Desc:[]},{ID:"1409011",Name:"Pluto\u2019s Page",Level:"Impuritas Civitatis",Source:"abcdef",Obtainable:"False",Rarity:"Objet D'art",Speed:[2,7],HP:380,StaggerHP:275,SResist:[0,0],PResist:[0,1],BResist:[1,0],Skin:"TwistedPluto",Passive:["1409011","1409012","1409013","1408012"],Desc:[""]},{ID:"1409021",Name:"Shade\u2019s Page",Level:"Impuritas Civitatis",Source:"abcdef",Obtainable:"False",Rarity:"Objet D'art",Speed:[2,7],HP:155,StaggerHP:95,SResist:[0,0],PResist:[0,0],BResist:[0,0],Skin:"JaeheonPuppetN",Passive:["1409021","1409022","1408012"],Desc:[""]},{ID:"1405011",Name:"Oswald\u2019s Page",Level:"Impuritas Civitatis",Source:"abcdef",Obtainable:"False",Rarity:"Objet D'art",Speed:[2,4],HP:250,StaggerHP:250,SResist:[1,1],PResist:[0,0],BResist:[1,1],Skin:"TwistedOswald",Passive:["1405000","1405011","1405012","1405013","1405014"],Desc:[""]},{ID:"1405021",Name:"Mr. Knife\u2019s Page",Level:"Impuritas Civitatis",Source:"abcdef",Obtainable:"False",Rarity:"Objet D'art",Speed:[2,4],HP:60,StaggerHP:40,SResist:[0,0],PResist:[0,0],BResist:[-2,-2],Skin:"OswaldBlade_Added",Passive:["1405000","1405021"],Desc:[""]},{ID:"1405031",Name:"Ms. Mermaid\u2019s Page",Level:"Impuritas Civitatis",Source:"abcdef",Obtainable:"False",Rarity:"Objet D'art",Speed:[1,3],HP:70,StaggerHP:50,SResist:[-2,-2],PResist:[0,0],BResist:[0,0],Skin:"OswaldMermaid_Added",Passive:["1405000","1405031"],Desc:[""]},{ID:"1405041",Name:"Mx.
